<!--
Because some browsers require a P3P policy, we have created a compact P3P policy
that outlines some, but not all, of the details of our privacy practices.  The
compact policy relates primarily to our use of HTML cookies and personally
identifiable information associated with such cookies.  However, we have not
included a full P3P policy because the binary limitations of the required XML
code currently do not fully and adequately express our policies and practices.
Instead, we ask that you read our full Privacy Notice at www.mvmnucleo.com/QuienesSomos.xsql
